CDM: The Console Display Manager
================================

New version 0.8:

	- added support for Wayland
	- moved the rc file path to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cdm/cdmrc`
	- fixed a bug that made `dialog` bork when TTY permissions were bogus
	- replaced every `/bin/bash` occurence with `/usr/bin/env bash`, making it easier to make it work on BSDs.

Version 0.7:

	- removed consolekit support
	- removed xtty
	- removed altstartx
	- cdmrc edited for new version
	- cdm-xlaunch removed

Invocation
----------

To run cdm, use

    $ cdm [RCFILE]

cdm tries to source configuration files in this order, and uses the first
existing one:

    [RCFILE specified on command line]
    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cdm/cdmrc
    $HOME/.cdmrc
    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cdm/cdmrc
    /etc/cdmrc

To autostart cdm when you log in your account, copy the content of
/usr/share/doc/cdm/zzz-cdm.sh to the tail of your shell profile (~/.profile,
etc.).


Customisation
-------------

See /etc/cdmrc for examples.
